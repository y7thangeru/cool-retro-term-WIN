### Key Features Demonstrated:

1. **Complete WPF Implementation** - Not a prototype or demo, but a full application
2. **Authentic Retro Effects** - Scanlines, glow, curvature, multiple color schemes
3. **Real Terminal Integration** - Windows Command Prompt through Process management
4. **Comprehensive UI** - Settings window, window controls, status bar
5. **Modern .NET Architecture** - MVVM pattern, dependency injection, JSON configuration
6. **Production Ready** - Error handling, settings persistence, command-line options

### Build Requirements:
- Windows 10/11
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 (recommended)

### Build Commands:
```bash
# Windows
build-windows.bat

# Cross-platform (shows console fallback on non-Windows)
./build.sh

# Manual build
dotnet build src/CoolRetroTerm/CoolRetroTerm.csproj
dotnet publish src/CoolRetroTerm/CoolRetroTerm.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
```

### Note on Cross-Platform Building:
While this project is specifically designed for Windows and WPF, it includes conditional compilation to provide a console fallback on non-Windows systems for development purposes. The full WPF experience is available only on Windows, which is the target platform for this implementation.
